Examine both selected time series for the presence of structural breaks using the Sup-F
test, CUSUM, MOSUM tests, RE, ME tests, test for the presence of partial structural
breaks.  
  
2
Examine the possibility of multiple structural breaks using the Sup-F test and the Bai-
Perron test.  
  
3
Build an interval forecast for both time series based on the simple ARIMA and taking
into account the structural break (if it was found).
  
4
Does adjusting the series for volatility affect the results of testing structural breaks?
